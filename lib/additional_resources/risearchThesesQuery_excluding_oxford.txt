The following query can be pasted into the risearch query interface to obtain a
list of all Thesis records. This will (correctly) include the two MNursing
theses which have been incorrectly put under Undergraduate Papers and Projects.
Note that this query uses SPARQL rather than ITQL,  in order to permit the wild
card searching necesary to differentiate postgrad theses from undergraduate
papers.  The machine the risearch interface is run on will need to have access
 to fedora/risearch permitted  on the hosts apache configuration. This
 redesigned query can be used without  updating and reconstructing when repeat
  exports are required
Excludes the thesis in the ebooks collection from Oxford Brookes, using a filter on
an optional dc:publisher element - excludes where found with this value
tried adding a filter on publisher for inclusion of york , but this fails as not all
publishers have this listed eg Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies; in
addition some theses do not (yet) have a dc:publisher element
WE dont filter the hasModel clause for publisher because the ebooks do not share the
CModel-Thesis model sso this is not an issue (and it breaks other parts of the query)
