exportFoxml.bat and exportExamFoxmlBatch.bat are template batch files which can
be run from within a fedora 3.6 client using the fedora API to perform bulk
exports of foxml files from a fedora 3.6 repository when provided with a list
of pids in a text file, one per line, in the following format:
york:1234
york:5678

to use: edit the files as indicated below
- in  exportFoxml.bat  replace <fully
qualified name of folder to export files into> with the actual path of the
folder to export to.
- <host>:<port>
- in exportExamFoxmlBatch.bat replace the following:
  <path to tee.exe> with the actual path to your tee.exe file
  <fully qualified path to  text file containing pids> with the actual path
  <fully qualified name of error file to write> path to write an error file to

  The files must be put into the fedora clients bin directory on the machine you
   are exporting into, and run from the command line, passing the user name and
   password as parameters thus:> exportExamBatch_LogTest.bat USER PWD

   On one occasion not all files were exported, so be careful to compare the
   number of lines in your pid list with the number of export files. the fedora
   api export function called by the scripts does not provide logging output, so
   I have piped the error output to an error file using tee - hopefully if
   future export errors occur this will allow missing files to be identified
